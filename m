One thing I haven't addressed yet is the regulator handling. Currently the
driver ignores all errors regulator_get(). This is incorrect and among other
things breaks probe deferral (EPROBE_DEFER). The correct behavior is to
propagate the error to the upper layers so they can handle it accordingly.
Another reason to do this is that the device can't work without power
enabled, so it needs a regulator connected. If the specific design uses a
static always-on regulator and does not explicitly specify it
regulator_get() will return the dummy regulator.

Another thing regarding regulator handling is that the names passed to
regulator_get() should match the name of the supply as specified in the
device datasheet. In this case the supply is called AVcc, while the driver
passes just "vcc". Since it is custom to use the lower-caps version of the
datasheet name this should be replaced with "avcc".

If you are interested in this type of issue I think you'll be able to find a
few more in the staging IIO tree that also need to be addressed. And
potentially even in the regular IIO tree. The following cocci snippet should
be able to help you identify potential candidates (it's not very
sophisticated, so there will be false positives and false negatives).

expression reg;
position p;
@@
reg = \(devm_regulator_get@p\|regulator_get@p\)(...);

	PTR_ERR(reg)
	...
}

I've pushed my changes to ad7606 driver for reference to
https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/linux/tree/iio-ad7605

I still need to test them with real hardware before I'll submit them and
this has to wait until after ELCE next week.

Nice catch, that's most certainly a bug. I didn't even notice this when
refactoring the code. Please send a fix.
