I feel like we are being too picky here, but this isn't the correct
wording.  It is possible for module parameters to be modified "later",
if the permissions on the parameter are set to allow this.  But that's
not what this driver does here, so this might be better phrased as:

  The module parameters in this driver can not be modified after
  loading, so they can be evaluated once at module load and set to
  default values if needed at that time.

You are listing all of _what_ you do here, not really _why_ you are
doing any of this.

Anyway, if I were writing this, here's what I would say as a changelog
text:

  The module parameters, read_timeout and write_timeout, are only ever
  evaluated at module load time, so set the default values then if
  needed so as to not recompute the timeout values every time the driver
  reads or writes data.


And that's it, short, concise, and it explains why you are doing this.

Writing changelog comments are almost always harder than actually
writing the patch (at least for me.)  So don't feel bad, it take a lot
of experience doing it.

All that being said, I think we are just polishing something that
doesn't need to really be polished anymore, so let me go just apply this
patch as-is to the tree now so you can move on to a different change.
You've put in the effort here, and I don't want you to get bogged down
in specifics that really do not matter at all overall (like the memory
size of your vm...)

thanks,
