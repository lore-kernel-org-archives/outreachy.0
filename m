No, this is not the right command... you are not invoking the linker to mak=
e=20
the .ko object.

Use "make M=3Ddrivers/staging/axis-fifo/"
or "make M=3Ddrivers/staging/axis-fifo/ W=3D1 -j8" (the latter to enable le=

warning and run on your 2 * 4 logical cores).

This is odd, it shouldn't :-/

As I said in another message, I'll set aside some time to help you check if=
=20
you need to fine tune your VM and Hypervisor configuration.=20

I'm returning on the same subject we have been talked about because you sai=

at least twice that your builds and install are too slow. We'll try to=20
diagnose it in an IRC session on #kernel-outreachy (I'm pretty sure for the=

Try again after building with "M=3Ddrivers/staging" (as said above). Don't=
=20
forget to run "make modules_install install" and then reboot into your cust=
om=20
built Kernel, not the distribution's kernel.

While you are there, run "lsmod" to see all loaded modules. Pick one random=
ly=20
from the output list and run "modinfo name_of_the_module_you_want_info_abou=
t".

Let me know if this time it works.

P.S.: Have you had time to read that "Linux Kernel Module Programming" guid=
e I=20
sent you the link of? You can find a lot of information about modules there=
=2E=20
I'd strongly recommend you to read it.=20
