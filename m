We know it's a patchset or series, saying so in subject line is 
redundant. Perhaps - 'Checkpatch cleanup in rxtx.c'

Expected to be in reverse order, with latest changes first.
ie. Here you would start with v8

State what changed. Do not expect your review to go back
hunting for past review comments.

Same for all below.

Move ( to end of line

This doesn't match what was actually done

Each commit msg needs to stand alone. The one above only makes
sense (still it's a poor message) when viewed in this patchset.
Once the patches are applied, it must stand alone.

The commit msg should read like a directive. Fix is too general.
Commit msg states what you did, commit log states why you did it.

I see you took 'refactoring' out of the commit messages, but left it
in the commit logs. It doesn't belong in the logs. As another
reviewer pointed out, this is not a refactor.
