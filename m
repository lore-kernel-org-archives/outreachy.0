Note, the compiler will tell you if you get this wrong, so this really
is not an issue.

The container_of() macro is "special" in that it is very type safe and
is very commonly used just as a #define to make it simpler and the
compiler can just do the pointer math automatically without ever needing
a function call to be involved.

It's actually more efficient to be a macro, so this isn't correct.

But all of this is really moot, and I would normally just take this
patch, but it's not correct:

You need a newline right before your new function to properly set it
off.

I'm going to be a stickler here, and say this really should be using the
new container_of_const() macro instead, and with that, you can NOT turn
it into an inline function at all due to the fun use of Generic in that
macro.

So I wouldn't recommend changing this macro at this time at all, sorry.
