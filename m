Hi Dan,
I did a code review to understand how this structure member is used and did not
find any computations you mentioned. I would certainly like to receive your feedback
as well.

My apologies for rushing patches in. I will hold on for feedback on these
patches before turning in any new patch involving similar change. I hope it is
okay to send a different type of patch though. Please correct if I am wrong.

Thank you for looking into the patches. Appreciate your time and feedback.
