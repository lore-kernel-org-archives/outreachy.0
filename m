Nice idea... But it's not yours :-)

Therefore, you should give credit to Greg with the following tag:

Suggested-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <...> 

Place the above-mentioned tag a line before the "Signed-off-by:" (which is 
always the last line, whatever other tags you might need to add).

If this patch was a v4 you should have put a log right here, after the three 
dashes, explaining what changed from one release to another, release after 
release. Please read some other well formatted and accepted patches for real 
world examples of how to write version logs.

However, this patch is _not_ a v4 (so no version log is needed after the three 
dashes). This is your _first_ patch that addresses Greg's suggested 
refactoring. Therefore, just put [PATCH] in the subject line.

That inappropriate "v4" seems to explain the second error showed by the patch-
bot. Thus, read carefully its message and ask for further explanations if 
something is still unclear.

Thanks,

Fabio

P.S.: The code looks good but I could not apply it in mainline tree. I don't 
know whether this patch is somehow broken or the driver's files differ between 
the most recent staging tree and mainline.

However, does it work for you on the most recent staging tree? Did you run 
checkpatch on your own patch? (I'm also asking this question because of the 
first error showed by the patch-bot). Can you git-reset to a previous state 
and reapply your own patches to your local work branch?
