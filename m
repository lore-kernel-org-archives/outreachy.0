It needs to be v2: resend from the correct email address.

When you send a patch a second time that always needs to be explained
because we don't remember all the email we get.  The v2 information is
really interesting as a reviewer.  Maybe I am wondering, "Did I respond
to the original email and is my complaint fixed?"

For RESEND patches it means that the first patch was perfect but
something broke down in the process.  Maybe a maintainer was on vacation
and accidentally ignored the patch.  If Greg asks you to resend
everything that's a kind of breakdown in the process as well, but just
add that information in the patch "Resending all the most/ patches
because it was confusing which one were supposed to be applied".

That information is super interesting because it shows we are all on the
same page about how to go forward.
