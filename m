This patch series modify the vme_user driver's place in
menuconfig (1/3), fixes a missing `depends on` line in a Kconfig file
(2/3), and rearrages the directory tree for the driver allowing a more
straightforward comprehension of its contents (3/3).

The 'vme_user/' driver is the only remaining vme-family driver in the
'staging/' tree, but its structure, entry in menuconfig and building
routines are still attached to the 'vme/' subtree now outside
'staging/'. The present patchset fixes it.

CHANGELOG
[PATCH 0/3] staging: vme: Restructuring menuconfig and tree
v1:
  Created PATCH 1/3 as a single patch
v2:
  Added PATCH 2/3 and 3/3, turning it into a patchset
v3:
  Fixed and improved commit messages according to previous comments by
  Greg and Alison (to whom I'm indebted for their kind reviews). The
  commit titles got changed to be more specific and use the present
  imperative tense as for Alison's suggestions. The message body got
  fixed according to Greg formatting comments. The changelogs were moved
  to the cover letter as per another suggestion by Alison, and I added
  missing details (like the update in the MAINTAINERS I failed to
  mention in v2) and made textual improvements for clarity that I also
  noticed.

[PATCH 1/3] staging: vme: Move vme_user to staging KConfig
v1:
 - Sourced "drivers/staging/vme/devices/Kconfig" in
   "drivers/staging/Kconfig" and unsourced in "drivers/vme/Kconfig".
v3:
 - Modified the commit subject and text body.

[PATCH 2/3] staging: vme: Add VME_BUS dependency to Kconfig
v2:
 - Added this patch to the patchset.
v3:
 - Modified the commit subject and text body.

[PATCH 3/3] staging: vme: Move 'vme/devices' to 'vme_user/'
v2:
 - Added this patch to the patchset
v3
 - Modified the commit subject and text body.

Bruno Moreira-Guedes (3):
  staging: vme: Adjusted VME_USER in Kconfig
  staging: vme: Fix missing `depends on` at KConfig
  staging: vme: "drivers/staging/vme" tree cleanup
