Less than 1 day later?

Please relax and always keep working on new things, don't let my
response time be the gateway for you doing work, otherwise you are not
going to get very much done at all.

You normally have to wait about 2 weeks to get a patch reviewed,
sometimes I go much faster, sometimes slower.  Either way, it's
uncertian...
