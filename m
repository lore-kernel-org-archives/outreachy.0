Kloudifold,

It'll probably take a bit for the change, allowing pseudonyms, to become
common knowledge. When the question comes up, you can just point to the
latest update to Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst as I've
done below.

Phillip,
I commented similar to you, and then discovered this:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d4563201f33a022fc0353033d9dfeb1606a88330

Pseudonyms now allowed.
