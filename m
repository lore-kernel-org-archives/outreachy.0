Actually, it is a simple coccinelle semantic script of my own making.
I executed the script against the drivers/staging/wlan-ng

I was trying to match scenarios like the following:
struct a {
 some var[1]
}
struct b{
 some var[0]
}
I was reading through the variable length array suggestions and I came
up with that.
