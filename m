I agree that it's not a terrible idea and that it's a big undertaking.
The code would be a little safer if people had the habit of making
functions, as it avoids the risk of parameterizing over the field name in
the third argument.  But the impact is probably lesser than for the
flexible array fixes.  But if we have the chance to clean up the staging
code, at least, then why not.

There do seem to be more than 100 definitions like:

#define to_dove_clk(hw) container_of(hw, struct dove_clk, hw)

where we have to hope that at all of the usage sites the argument is
called hw.  Probably anything else would cause a compiler error, but still
it looks strange.
