An array of [1] at the _end_ of a structure is a hint that it might be a
variable length array, but I think all of those instances are already
caught in the tree due to the work of others.  See the archives of the
linux-hardening mailing list for the work happening there on this, and
for coccinelle scripts to help out if you are interested.

But note, I don't know if this has anything to do with outreachy
application stuff, so don't think I'm asking you to do anything here.
