'Adjusted' is unecessarily vague. In the commit msg try to say
exactly what the patch did. Write in the imperative tense, like
you are issuing commands.

Something like 'Move VME staging driver to staging Kconfig' , or
'Source vme driver from staging Kconfig'.

Skip the 'IMHO'. It's all your HO and if you state anything incorrectly,
your reviewers should catch it. If you are truly making a wild guess
about something, either look into it further, or not it in a question
below the '---'.

This commit message is otherwise very well written. It explains the
why of this patch nicely. 

Again, for this set, perhaps the changelog in the cover letter only.
