Therefore, you are using a Linux guest on a Linux host. This is a wise choi=
ce.=20
However, you didn't say where you are running your builds...

I mean, the better things to do are the following steps:

1) Your workspace with the staging tree should stay in the host.
2) Shut down your guest in order to have all RAM and all logical processors=
=20
available for the build.
3) Run "make -j8" in the host. Since you shutdown your guest VM you can use=
=20
all 8 logical cores and the maximum available RAM (without the VM draining=
=20
resources while building)
4) When the build is done, switch on your VM on VMware with at least 4 logi=
cal=20
cores and 6GB of reserved RAM.
5) Mount your cloned base directory as a shared folder between host and gue=
st.
6) In the guest, 'cd' to the shared folder and then run "make modules_insta=
ll=20
install" (in the guest, attention). This will install and configure the=20
kernel, the modules, GRUB2 and everything else in your guest VM.
7) Reboot the VM and test your patches.

This procedure will speed up your next builds.
The fundamental point is that you don't need to partition precious resource=
s=20
while building, Do everything without running the VM and switch it on only =
for=20
install and tests. Since you only build in the host but never install and b=
oot=20
in it, you don't risk any system's damage.

This is what I do for Kernel development purposes.

I hope it helps to answer your question about how to run fast recompilation.
