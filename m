Hey Fabio!
Thank you for letting me know. I was confused as to where should I
mention that this change was recommended by Greg.

Okay, got it! I shouldn't have missed it.

Thank you! It is clear. I will send this again as first_patch.

Yes,  I did run checkpatch on my patch as suggested by Dan before. It
showed errors regarding trailing white spaces. Sorry, I ignored them
thinking that they were present before in the code. I will correct them
in the next patch submission.

Also, I had one question. Is it okay to write a long subject as I have
used in this patch?
