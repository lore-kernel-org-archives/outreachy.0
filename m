As Greg asked, it would be good know the performance impact of such
change.  This could be measured by creating a lot of related allocations
and accessing them in non-sequential order (e.g. adding new rules,
accessing a related inode while being sandboxed).  I guess there will be
a lot of noise (because of other subsystems) but it's worth a try.  You
should look at similar commits and their related threads to see what
others did.

Not being able to create this kmem cache would mean that Landlock would
not be able to properly run, so we could print a warning and exit the
Landlock init function.  However, most calls to kmem_cache_create() are
init calls, and most of them (especially in security/*) set SLAB_PANIC.
I'm wondering why Landlock should do differently, if others should be
fixed, and if the extra complexity of handling several
kmem_cache_create() potential failure is worth it for init handlers?

Yes, it may looks weird but we format everything with clang-format to
not waste time discussing about style.
