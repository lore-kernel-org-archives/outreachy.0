Hi Dan,
Not trying to speak for you, so please override my message if this is
inaccurate.

Hi Khadija,
Yes. It is not useful to resolve one warning and introduce another. Tomorrow
someone else is going to try and revert it. So do not make the "remove tab"
change. I still like the merging of the split lines. It appears to improve code
readability. You can send in a v3 with just that merge change and wait for
feedback.

Also, remember to check your change with checkpatch. There is a section about
post-commit hooks on the tutorials page. This will allow you to integrate
checkpatch as part of your git commit step and do the job for you.

And also, always build your change locally on your machine. No new warnings or
errors should arise.

Hope that helps.
Deepak.
