Tanju, some additional hints.  First of all, please don't send cleanup
patches to address checkpatch --file complaints about overly long
lines.  It's generally not worth the code churn.

Secondly for code that *you* are writing, think about why you have
lines which are exceeding the line width in the first place.  Is it
because code is being nested too deeply, and perhaps some judicious
function refactoring with good function names might make the code
clearer?  Would adding some temporary variables that are judiciously
named make the code look clearer?

The rules about "thou shalt never have lines which exceed 78
characters" are rules of thumb.  The high level goal is to make the
code more readable and easier to understand, since good code is
maintainable code.  And sometimes it's not just about where to split
lines of code but whether there is a better way to structure the code
so that long lines aren't needed in the first place.

Cheers,

					- Ted
