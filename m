Thanks for the rewrite.

I find "source this value out of" hard to understand.

I would have written something like the following:

The function dim_get_channel_state only serves to initialize the ready and
done_buffers fields of the structure passed as its second argument.  In
service_done_flag, this structure is never used again and the only purpose
of the call is to get the value that is put in the done_buffers field.
But that value is just the done_sw_buffers_number field of the call's
first argument.  So the whole call is useless, and we can just replace it
with an access to this field.

This change implies that the variable st is no longer used, so drop it as
well.

If you want to work some more in this code, the name of the type
dim_ch_state_t should not have an _t at the end of it.  It looks like it
used to be a typedef and someone eliminated the typedef but didn't drop
the _t.
