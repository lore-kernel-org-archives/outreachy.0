Kloudifold emailed me because it wasn't clear how to respond to the
conflicting review comments.  I was going to respond privately but I
thought it was an interesting topic for Outreachy.

First of all, this patch needs to be resent because of the issue with
the email headers.

Second, when reviewers disagree there are three factors:
1) Who has the most authority over the patch?
2) Who cares the most?
3) What do *you* want to do?

If you get feedback from Greg, then you have to listen to Greg.
Probably Julia and I outrank Bagas in terms of authority.

In terms of who cares the most, Bagas is the only person ever to
complain about lists.  On the other hand, no one has ever insisted on
lists.  So keeping the list is fine and removing the list is also fine.

Third, Bagas complained about these tags:

I happen to know that Greg doesn't like them too much so just delete
them.  I noticed the links in the earlier email but it's not something
I care about personally so I didn't say anything.

The other thing is that Outreachy people are very very strict about
process issues and commit messages.  That's because Outreachy is an
educational thing.  But in real life, the focus is just on adding value.
If you send a high value patch such as a security fix, then I will take
whatever you send, clean it up, add a commit message and still give you
authorship credit.  Or if you add a driver, then I'm not going to
endlessly nitpick your grammar or whatever.  We do have minimum
standards like checkpatch clean etc and we definitely don't want bugs.
But driver code is all different levels of quality because having a
driver is better than having nothing.

So if you want your patches to get merged then work on high value stuff
and we're much more flexible for that.

dan carpenter
