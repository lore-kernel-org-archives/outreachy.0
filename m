You forgot to at least cc: the people/list on the MAINTAINERS entry that
you are removing here, to give them a hint that this is happening in
case they want to speak up here (and to give us the ability to point to
that years later when they complain they were never notified...)

Also, if you are in the "delete code" mood, I think drivers/staging/vme/
and drivers/vme/ can probably also be deleted given that the maintainer
for that has moved on to other jobs.  Ask them and see!

thanks,
