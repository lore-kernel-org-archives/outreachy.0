Hi Khadija,

Please put one or two blank lines between the last message you are replying=
=20
and the new you are writing (exactly as I'm doing here between "Hey Alison!=
"=20
and "Hi Khadija").

Great!

I suppose that "w=3D1" is a typo. The option is enabled with "W=3D1" (capit=
al=20
case, Linux and all UNIX-like are case-sensitive).=20

What is you choice for 'X' in "-jX"?
Did you try with the exact number of logical cores?
Are you building into a VM with enough logical cores?=20
If you are building into a VM, did you reserve enough RAM?

Please read carefully my questions above and try to understand your=20
environment and reply, so that I can help you more effectively.

The steps to reproduce will take your precious time and use more resources.=
=20
Again, try to respond my questions.

> After dealing with these warnings I will send a [PATCH v5], following

Sorry for inadvertently overlooking to warn you about to send a message to=
=20
Greg and ask him to drop your first 3 + 1 patches. Now you are doing good b=
y=20
following what Alison suggested: send v5 and write the log of revisions und=
er=20
the three dashes (exactly how Alison explained).

> Kindly, let me know if I am on the wrong track.
> Thank you!
>=20

I think you are in the right track.
Let's try to speed up your builds because you'll need to build again your=20
kernel many, many times for future works. =20

Thanks,

=46abio
