It's also unnecessary to cast void pointers so the cast could be removed.

	struct dvb_demux_feed *dvbdmxfeed = priv;

And the code here uses dvbdmxfeed and feed rather interchangeably for
uses of a struct dvb_demux_feed *.

It might be better just to use feed and change the other uses too.

Do consider this just a coding exercise as the driver is for some
hardware that is effectively dead/unavailable/non-functional.

Look at:

    media: av7110: move driver to staging
    
    This driver is really old, from devices that aren't
    manufactured anymore for more than a decade.

Maybe instead consider adding a MAINTAINERS section
suggesting this is obsolete and/or a TODO entry in this
directory saying "Delete this" after some time.
