No. Greg took your patch as is.
No new versions for patches that Maintainers (i.e., Greg Kroah-Hartman for=
=20
drivers/staging and several other subsystems and drivers) already applied.

We've been discussing this topic after Greg had already taken your patch on=
ly=20
for the purpose to clarify to you why he suggested a better commit message.=
=20
However, he suggested that better message while stating that he prefers to=
=20
take your patch as is to give you time to work on something new.

I suppose that you received the two automated messages, the first which=20
communicates that your patch has been applied to his staging-test tree and =
the=20
second which says that it has moved forward to the next step, which is the=
=20
staging-next tree. I saw those messages in Cc because I put my "Reviewed-by=
"=20
tag to your patch, so I know you had them.

P.S.: Today I sent you an off-list message. Please locate it and reply.
