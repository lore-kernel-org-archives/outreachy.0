I would still prefer to see that the structure is only passed to a certain
function, and that function only uses the structure in a certain way (fill
in the exact details).  In this case, one may just rely on the fact that
the parameter that receives the value is also declared as const, or one
could check that that const declaration is actually correct.  I think that
is what Ayush was trying to do, although in a somewhat verbose way.  This
case is a bit more complex than many others, because the structure isn't
used locally, but is passed off to some other function.
