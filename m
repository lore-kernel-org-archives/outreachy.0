Delete the last two lines.

As Greg made you notice, it was not the Kernel Test Robot that had reported=
=20
you an issue for which you decided to make a patch to fix it.

The reason you made this patch is because you know that the Linux kernel st=
yle=20
guide wants developers to avoid camel-case symbols.

Before your "Signed-off-by" tag, you should only credit those tools and/or=
=20
services (checkpatch.pl, Coccinelle, Smatch, Syzkaller/Syzbot, GCC, Clang, =
and=20
so on) that had noticed that Linux has a problem that predates the first=20
version of your patch and that your first version has the purpose to fix th=
at=20
problem.

You made this patch because _checkpatch_ had reported issues with camel-cas=
e=20
improper use, so you decided to convert some names to snake-case. You are=20
invited to credit only _checkpatch_ for you patch ("Reported by=20
checkpatch.pl.").

That credit is part of the commit message so, when you credit that tool, pu=
t a=20
blank line after the credit and before the "Signed-off-by" tag.=20

> Signed-off-by: Kloudifold <cloudifold.3125@gmail.com>

Instead, you should delete this blank line after your sign.

This is the place to credit the Kernel Test Robot for noticing that you mad=
e=20
mistakes with v1 and that v2 is for fixing them.

Therefore, give credit here to the Robot:

Thanks,

P.S.: Someone suggested to drop the "sm750_" prefix. I don't think you shou=
ld=20
do anything like this because I don't see "static" functions prefixed by=20
"sm750_" in your patch. However, later you may check if they can be "static=
"=20
and, if so, drop the prefix and make them "static" (in a follow up patch). =
