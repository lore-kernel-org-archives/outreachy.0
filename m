Yes, as I don't see a v3 here.  All I see is a mess of commits in a
thread and not a way to easily determine which ones to, and not to,
apply/ignore.

Make it blindingly obvious for me (and everyone else) which is your
latest patch series and which to apply/review.

Remember, some of us get thousands of emails a day to deal with, and
right now I have over 2000 in my review queue to get through.  Making my
life simpler is the best thing if you want your patch to be accepted.

thanks,
