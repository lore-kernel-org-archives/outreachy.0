If you checked it manually, just mention that.  I don't have the actual
patches handy any more, but you could also say something like:

Remove & from function pointers to conform to the style found elsewhere in
the file.  Done using the following semantic patch.

This would be ok if the included semantic patch makes the change.  It
doesn't suggest that the semantic patch checkked for the excpeptionality.
