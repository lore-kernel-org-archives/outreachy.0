Are you sure it is useless?

You have changed the logic here, you are now thinking that this value
can never change, while before you were ensured of getting the "correct"
value as it is under the lock when the function is called.

I can't take this type of change as a "cleanup" patch for outreachy
unless you have the hardware as it is NOT a basic "checkpatch" style
cleanup at all.

If you want to get this change accepted, please work with the maintainer
of the code and get them to agree that the change is correct.  And if it
is, odds are more things also would need to be cleaned up at the same
time, right?

thanks,
