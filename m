Hello David,
I looked through the data sheets for these hardware [ad983*] and believe the
divisor max can attain 75MHz which fits well in a 32 bit size. Hence the
proposed changes for these drivers to switch to div64_ul may actually slowdown
the division. Please correct if I said something incorrect.

Requesting to kindly ignore my proposed changes.

Thank you for the detailed explanation. This is very helpful.
