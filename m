Hey Alison!
Based on Nathan's feedback I am trying to recompile and send a patch
without any warnings.
As suggested by Fabio, I am running "make w=1 -jX" command to see if I
get any warnings. But it is taking a lot of time, is there any way of
speeding it up?
If this doesn't work then I have to follow the steps to reproduce in lkp
mail as you said before. 
After dealing with these warnings I will send a [PATCH v5], following
your instructions above.
Kindly, let me know if I am on the wrong track.
Thank you!

Regards,
Khadija
