Hi Khadija,

Sorry for being here so late.

I just saw also your other messages with further help requests.
Please do other work while waiting for help on a specific issue.=20

If I understand you correctly, you are saying that you can only build axis-
fifo in-kernel because you cannot change the '*' to 'm'. Correct?

If so, you have probably touched other configuration options in a way that=
=20
forces that driver to work only if compiled in-kernel). Therefore, I'd rest=
art=20
from scratch.

Please delete your current .config and make a copy of the one from your=20
running kernel. Then check the three options Alison and I were talking abou=
t.=20

Remember that you cannot see the axis-fifo module entry (CONFIG_XIL_AXIS_FI=
=46O)=20
in "Device Drivers" -> "Staging Drivers" section if you have not yet enable=
d =20
(either with 'm' or 'y') CONFIG_OF and CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM.=20

Now you should end up with a visible CONFIG_XIL_AXIS_FIFO that can be enabl=
ed=20
as a module with 'm'.=20

Let me know if this procedure works.
