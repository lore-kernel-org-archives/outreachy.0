Thanks for helping Khadija (and also me, indirectly, because I helped them =
to=20
make that commit message). After a little less than 200 commits already=20
upstream, there is still to learn how to make a good changelog (which I thi=
nk=20
it's not less important than the code in the patch). =20

Yes, thanks. It's time to move on.

You probably didn't pay attention to the problems Khadija has being=20
experiencing with memory exhaustion and compilation times.=20

=46irst time they complained had several crashes while building and message=
s=20
saying there was not enough available memory. Then several other problems w=
ith=20
builds' time. Finally, yesterday they wrote that "make modules_install=20
install" took "hours" (literally).

This is why I think they should also be helped with their VM configuration=
=20
(despite it was unrelated to the patch). They won't be able to work on some=
=20
projects if they cannot do quick builds and run hundreds of tests in no tim=
e=20
(e.g., I'm especially talking about Ira's and my project about the conversi=
ons=20
from kmap{,_atomic}() to kmap_local_page()).

I understand that this is only noise for you, as a maintainer. However I'm=
=20
pretty sure that they need help with speeding up builds and installation. T=
he=20
projects cannot wait "hours" just for install of modules and kernel images.

Again thanks for your precious suggestions about how to improve commit=20
messages.
