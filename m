Tanjuate,

Wow - I've seen 4 revs of this in 12 hours?!

I reviewed each Patch against the feedback previously
offered, and it was not addressed, so I'm going to NAK
this set and ask you to rework carefully before resending.
I expect to see each specific piece of reviewer feedback,
called out as addressed in the changelog.

BTW - I still prefer a single patch at a time while you are
learning these mechanics, and to make sure that this type
of patch is going to be accepted.

If you are still amenable to doing that, keep the version,
but only send one patch at a time. When one gets accepted,
apply those learnings to the second patch, and so on.

That should go more smoothly for you and your reviewers.

Alison
