Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to say this. What I wrote is _not_ what I meant.=20
My intention was to say the same that you may read below about=20
k[un]map_atomic().

This sentence should have been:

+ It always returns a valid virtual address. It is assumed that
+ k[un]map_local() won't ever fail.

Is this rewording correct?

It's not my first time I make these kinds of silly mistakes when copy-
pasting lines and then rework or merge with other text that was already=20
there. Recently I've made a couple of these kinds of mistakes.

I'd better read twice (maybe thrice) what I write before sending :(

I suppose you are talking about the kdocs comments in code. If so, please=20
remember that the kmap_local_page() kdocs have already been included in =20
highmem.rst.

Am I misunderstanding what you write?

Yes, correct. I'll fix it.

Now that I have your reviews for all the four patches of this series I'll=20
send next version on Monday.
