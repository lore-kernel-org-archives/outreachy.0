I was trying to work through a patch for ade7754. So ran into the same
problem :)

The only nested lock here is ade7754_spi_write_reg_16, so as long as
that is refactored, it'll be fine.

Another question that I have is why are we writing inside a read
function(ade7754_spi_read_reg_24)?

static int ade7754_spi_read_reg_24(struct device *dev,
                                   u8 reg_address, u32 *val)
{
        struct iio_dev *indio_dev = dev_to_iio_dev(dev);
        struct ade7754_state *st = iio_priv(indio_dev);
        int ret;
        struct spi_transfer xfers[] = {
                {
                        .tx_buf = st->tx,
                        .rx_buf = st->rx,
                        .bits_per_word = 8,
                        .len = 4,
                },
        };

        mutex_lock(&st->buf_lock);
        st->tx[0] = ADE7754_READ_REG(reg_address);
        st->tx[1] = 0;
        st->tx[2] = 0;
        st->tx[3] = 0;

        ret = spi_sync_transfer(st->us, xfers, ARRAY_SIZE(xfers));
        if (ret) {
                dev_err(&st->us->dev, "problem when reading 24 bit
register 0x%02X",
                        reg_address);
                goto error_ret;
        }
        *val = (st->rx[1] << 16) | (st->rx[2] << 8) | st->rx[3];

error_ret:
        mutex_unlock(&st->buf_lock);
        return ret;
}
