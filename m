Why is this all indented?

Please do not do that, look at existing accepted changes in the git log
and match up what they look like.

But worst of all, you didn't really fix the variable name at all.  You
just appeased a tool that was trying to say "don't use camelCase, use
sane names".

"pvRTS" is using Hungarian Notation.  Look it up on Wikipedia for what
it means, and why people used to use it.

For us, we don't need that at all as the type of the variable is obvious
in the code and the compiler checks it.

So "pvRTS" is trying to say "this is a pointer to void called "RTS".

We don't care about the "describe the variable type in the name" thing,
so it should just be called "RTS", or better yet, "rts", right?

But then, step back.  Why is this a void pointer at all?  This is really
a structure of type struct vnt_rts_g_fb.  So why isn't that being passed
here instead?

So try to work on both, fixing up the names to be sane, and then,
getting rid of the void * stuff, to better reflect how data is flowing
around and what type that data is in.

thanks,
