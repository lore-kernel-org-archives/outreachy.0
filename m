Hi,

Glad you are picking this back up!
I know Ira sent you some links to refactoring info. Go back and
look at those.

When we submit patches that refactor a function, we try to make
the patches obviously correct and easy to review.

I'll tell you how I approached this one, and you can see how
it works for you:

1. Edit the function until it is just how you'd like it. Hint:
   no lines over 80, minimal indentation.

{
	--snip--

	if (!gpiod_get_value(arche_pdata->wake_detect))
                goto falling;

        /* wake/detect rising */

	

falling:
	/* wake/detect falling */


out:
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&arche_pdata->wake_lock, flags);

        return rc;
}


2. Figure out how you can present that in patches. This function
   is just long enough that I think you have to split it up into
   two or more obvious steps, rather than throwing it into one
   patch.

How about you do Step 1, and send the diff to the Outreachy mailing
list (only) for review. Please start a new thread.
