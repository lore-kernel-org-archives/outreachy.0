Dan,

Thank-you for all the suggestions and support you offer the
Outreachy applicants.


Kloudifold,

Despite the fact that the driver is on it's way 'out', GregKH may
have merged your patch, recognizing it as an Outreachy exercise,
if it was otherwise correct. 

In Outreachy, for the first patches, the goal is to get the patch
mechanisms correct. That's why we don't ask for high value patches
as your first, or second, or third.... patch. Once you have the
mechanism down, you progress to higher value patches.

For Outreachy applicants, that usually means a checkpatch format
cleanup, and then moving on to sparse, smatch, or other suggestions
from reviewers. The higher value items for Outreachy are often
something that caught a reviewers eye in your simple cleanup.

This smatch warning list from Dan is useful, however, none of the
warnings are from drivers/staging. Outreachy suggests sending
patches for drivers/staging.

Look for patch suggestions posted by Deepak, Julia, and I on the
Outreachy mailing list.

BTW - as Dan recently mentioned, patch reviewers often give conflicting
feedback. It's healthy conflict. We all want to improve the kernel, and
to help you improve as a kernel contributor. 

Welcome to the kernel community,
Alison
