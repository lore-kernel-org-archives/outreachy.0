Sorry, I made a typo in the sentence above and that may confuse you :-(

I just intended to suggest to delete "Perform same steps formodule paramete=
r,=20
write_timeout.".

In the previous lines I suggested you to merge and rework your entire commi=
t=20
message. If you like it you are left with the following text (that I put fo=
r=20
you between two '"'):

"Initialize the module parameters read_timeout and write_timeout once in
init().

Module parameters can only be set once and cannot be modified later, so we
don't need to evaluate them again when passing the parameters to
wait_event_interruptible_timeout().

Convert the type of {read,write}_timeout from 'int' to 'long int' because=20
implicit conversion of 'long int' to 'int' in statement 'read_timeout =3D=20
MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT' results in an overflow.".

Just three small sentences are all you need (and don't forget to change the=
=20
Subject - "probe()" -> "init()".

I hope I have been clearer this time.
If not, please ask for further clarification.

Thanks,

When you are done with build, install, and final reboot to test if your mod=
ule=20
can "modprobe" or "insmod" (i.e. link with the running custom kernel you=20
built, installed and boot), try to compare the output of the following=20
commands:

# uname -a
Linux suse 6.2.2-1-default #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Mar  9 06:06:13 UTC 2=
023=20
(44ca817) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

AND

# modinfo <name of the module you are testing here>

I'm running "modinfo kvm" (but showing only two of many lines):

# modinfo kvm=20
filename:       /lib/modules/6.2.2-1-default/kernel/arch/x86/kvm/kvm.ko.zst
vermagic:       6.2.2-1-default SMP preempt mod_unload modversions=20

Can you see that the kernel in "uname -a" and the filename and vermagic hav=
e=20
the same "6.2.2-1-default"? Well, so I'm sure I'm running the right Kernel =
and=20
inserted the appropriate "kvm" module.=20

=46urthermore, before rebooting your custom kernel, you may also look at th=
e=20
directory in the Kernel where you compiled your module and search for "*.o"=
=20
"*mod*" and "*.ko" files. If you have them, you built your module properly.

Thanks,

=46abio
