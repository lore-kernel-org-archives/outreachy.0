Aside from what I said and asked for with the other message of this same=20
thread, please take note that you can build a specific module if you prefer=
=20
not to re-build the whole kernel and other modules at the same time.=20

I'm pretty sure that the instructions to do so are in the OutreachyFirstPat=
ch=20
tutorial.

If they are not there, please let us know.
