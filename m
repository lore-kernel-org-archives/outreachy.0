Remove unnecessary or unused code.


Changes in v5:
   1. Earlier patch send did not work as expected. The emails did not thread
      well. Hence resending as v5.

Changes in v4:
   1. Resubmit patch set with the remaining only patch. Update patch subject,
      version and patch sequence number to avoid confusion.
      Suggested by gregkh@linuxfoundation.org.

Changes in v3:
   Patch-1:
      1. Already accepted and applied to the stating-testing tree. Hence not
         included in this patch set now.
   Patch-2:
      1. The patch caused staging tree build to fail due to EXPORT_SYMBOL
         conflict. Fixed the issue caused due to deletion of 2 macros.
         Correction and re-submission asked by gregkh@linuxfoundation.org

Changes in v2:
   Patch-1:
      1. Revise patch log to explain impact of the patch
         Suggested by gregkh@linuxfoundation.org
   Patch-2:
      1. Review other similar macro defines and clean those up as well.
         Suggested by gregkh@linuxfoundation.org
      2. Revise patch log to explain impact of the patch
         Suggested by julia.lawall@inria.fr
