You sent this twice?

Anyway...

Make that a second patch, and resend it as part of a patch series since
your first patch here is gone from my queue.

That is expected.

That is because you built the driver into the tree, so there is nothing
to cause the taint code to run as there is no module loader involved.

It's expected and works the same for all staging drivers.  Try it

If you can figure out how to do so, that would be interesting to see.
