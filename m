Khadija,

I think that you are trying to skip some passages. Let me explain better...

Soon after copying from /boot your new .config you should run "make=20
menuconfig" or "make oldconfig" to re-create the necessary dependence and=20
other files which are required to build properly.

I'd suggest "make menuconfig" so that you can check if you enabled correctl=
y=20
the module(s) you are interested to build and other built-in options you ma=
y=20
optionally need.

Then you must rebuild and install. So...

1) "make menuconfig" (don't forget to save before exiting),
2) "make W=3D1 -j8" (because you have 8 logical cores reserved to your VMWa=
re=20
VM, correct?).
3) "make modules_install install".

At this point check that you have a fresh kernel image in /boot, that /boot/
grub/grub.conf contains a new entry with your freshly built custom kernel s=
o=20
that you can boot it from selecting the proper entry in the menu that you'l=
l=20
see after reboot. Also check that you have axis-fifo.ko under /lib/modules/
<the new kernel version>/build/drivers/staging/axis-fifo/.

=46or example in my VM for test I see axis-fifo with...

ls -l /lib/modules/6.3.0-rc2-x86-32-debug+/build/drivers/staging/axis-fifo/
total 564

(as you can see, the last time I built and installed the kernel and the axi=
s-
fifo driver's module was March 17, 15:39).

Please notice that my kernel has that "-x86-32-debug+" suffix after the ker=
nel=20
version but this depends on a special option I need to set to differentiate=
=20
"debug" kernels from "production" kernels. You may have something else that=
=20
your distribution appends.

If you can't find the module run again "ls -l" one level up, like in /lib/
modules/6.3.0-rc2-x86-32-debug+/build/drivers/staging/ to see if at least y=
ou=20
have any of the drivers/staging/ modules. Go one more layer up if you don't=
=20
find them.

If everything I cited above is where it is supposed to be and grub.conf is=
=20
properly configured with the new entry, reboot and enjoy your module (try=20
modprobe, modinfo, lsmod, and the likes).
