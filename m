It sounds like the git commit hook for checkpatch, suggested in
the tutorial, would have saved you here. Please look that up.

Also see the section "Following the Driver commit style"
And, there are sections on revising patchsets too.

Much of the info in the tutorial doesn't make sense until you
need it. So, keep reviewing it to catch more useful info.

More on running checkpatch:
- Add that git commmit hook.
- The final checkpatch run can be on the formatted patches.
  After you've done git format-patch and have a .patch file you
  are thinking of sending, run it again. 

Something like this:
scripts/checkpatch.pl --no-tree --strict --codespellfile=/usr/bin/codespell ~/my_patches/*.patch

This is in the tutorial. section "Following the Driver commit style"
