Hi Julia,
I could see the macro expansions in the .i files for the fbtft-core.c and
fb_hx8353d.c file. I am not sure why it built successfully on my x86 though. The
error in Kerbel bot seems to be specific to ARM arch. I will try that later
today. I am on the right track to the build error triage?

Also, while reviewing the macro expansion, I saw change in the computation that
seems odd to me. In the denominator of the expanded macro, there is a "+
((int)...." computation that I am not sure if is result of ARRAY_SIZE. I have
attached the old anf the new .i file diff for your review. If you get a change
could you help me understand why this additional computation is added to the
denominator?
