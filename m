No, you can not change the format of the data on the bus without also
changing the firmware in the device and usually the specification as
well.

What is wrong with buf[0] here?

You can fix this in other ways if you really understand the difference
between [0] and [] in C.  Please look at many of the other conversions
if you wish to do this.
