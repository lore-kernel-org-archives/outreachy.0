This type of documentation should (and I believe is, in the kdoc of
kmap_local_page().  Why not just add this text (or enhance what is there) and
include that here?

Ah I see that patch 2/2 does add the kdocs for the functions... ah ok  :-/

Perhaps this section should focus on why to use each of the kmap calls and not
how?  Leave the how to the kdoc?  Although all this information would be nice
inside the header for programmers who are looking at using these functions.

Here is an example of how I dealt with this on a recent auxiliary bus
documentation update:

I like this paragraph especially the last sentence!  Nicely put!

But this is another reason I think this text in the code next to the kmap
calls.  Then it is more readily available to programmers who are looking at the
functions.

Thanks for the great work so far!
