Khadija,

I'm not yet sure whether or not you are doing well with reserving 13GB to a=
=20
VM. First of all you should better use multiples of 2GB. Furthermore it loo=
ks=20
too much memory unless you have a total "real" RAM in your host exceeding=20
18GB. You must be sure you are leaving enough room for the Windows host to =
run=20
smoothly and avoid too much swapping to/from disk.

At the same time I doubt that you can reserve 8 logical cores (2x4) for=20
running the VM on VMWare.

However, we have time to investigate and adjust your configuration (if it=20
really needs to be fine tuned). I'll try to reach you on IRC, open a privat=
e=20
window, and assist with this task ASAP.

At the moment I'd prefer to see you focusing on getting your first patch=20
accepted by Greg.

Thanks,
