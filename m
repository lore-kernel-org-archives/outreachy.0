Hey Fabio!
Sorry for reaching out to you very late. For the past two days I have
had problems with my Virtual Machine. It is stuck at boot, and this
happened after it accidentally shut down. I have tried to resolve this
problem but nothing is working. Currently I have boot into an older
kernel version from the GRUB menu. 

I am also sharing the error here:
Gave up waiting for root device. Common problems:
-Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
  -Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)
-Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
ALERT! UUID=718ed077-947d-4018-80ad-59825678e81d does not exist.
Dropping to a shell!
BusyBox v1.27.2 (Ubuntu 1:1.27.2-2ubuntu3.2) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

I have Windows10 installed and I have created Ubunutu 22.04.1 VM on VMWare with
13GB RAM and 2 processors(4 cores each).

This command gives error saying: 
scripts/Makefile.build:41: /drivers/staging/axis-fifo/Makefile: 
No such file or directory
make[1]: *** No rule to make target '/drivers/staging/axis-fifo/Makefile'.  Stop.

Yes I would love that. Kindly help me with this.
Thank you!
