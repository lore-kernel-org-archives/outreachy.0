Hi Sumitra,

Please pay attention to the suggestions that Julia kindly provides to you.

A moment ago I read these other words from her to you: "Sorry to press the 
point, but you should be doing it now, not promising to do it in the future.".

She is sorry to press because of her special attitudes. I've been helped 
uncountable times by Julia who, despite her major role and commitments, is so 
kind to spend time here in a Sunday morning. 

I think that it's you who should be sorry for pushing her that way... 

You are doing it again and again: in your last message you did not provide the 
necessary context. You are asking me to recall which "insights" you are 
talking about. I know for sure that here there is someone who read hundreds of 
emails per day.

Don't summarize my own words in order to make me understand what question you 
are answering. Just put my question/objection/comment inline while replying.

Most mentors here read several tens of emails per day. You should not expect 
them to skim the whole thread. Just reply inline, so they find all the 
necessary context in one place and so there is no need to traverse the thread 
to understand what you are referring to. 

You have been told so several times. You risk that someone starts to ignore 
your messages in order to save time for other applicants.

This is a great idea and I fully agree with you.
Please ask Alison to grant access to change that documentation (it's not 
something I can do myself).

Best applicants go on with further contributions after the end of these 
period. This fact has been observed several times in the other rounds.
I'd like to see more people who are seriously willing to be part of this 
Community, regardless of the Outreachy project's deadlines.

Thanks,

Fabio

P.S.: I probably went a bit too far in the first part of this email. I am 
sorry about it. However, please demonstrate that you finally got it, not with 
further promises but with actual changes in the way you communicate :-)
