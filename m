I think that is because it is being used to map a structure on top of a
data blob read from the device.  Dig in and I think you will find where
it is mapped somewhere.

I'm interested in what tool told you that this was a variable length
array that should be modified?  It is a 1 element array, in the middle
of a structure, which is not what a variable length array looks like at
all, so perhaps some tool needs to be fixed as to not trigger on valid
code like this?
