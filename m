This patch is already sent, so I'll trim most of this message to avoid
duplicating the discussions. There's only one thing I'd like some input
first, if you don't mind.

I think I might have figured out. In "include/modules.h" and
"include/init.h" I happened to notice the driver initialization is
handled by some macros. After some inspection through gcc -E and looking
how they are defined, I figured out a scenario (when MODULE is not
defined) where the module_init() macro is defined as (among other
things) an inline initcall function that wraps the driver initialization
function.

So I thought about implementing it by creating a -DSTAGING flag in=20
drivers/staging/Makefile, and then using this macro to make an #ifdef
STAGING to add a similar inline wrapping function, except that in this
case the function makes a pr_warning() before calling the initialization
function.

Do you think it would be a good way of solving that?
