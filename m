Hi Ethan,

I haven't seen Greg's official stance on this matter, however as far
as I can see this is my view on this topic: the staging driver got
deleted at one point in time via my patch that goes through netdev
tree. If after that patch is merged into staging-next which affects a
file which is removed it will cause a merge conflict when they flow
into mainline tree, therefore it would be the best to just drop all
the rtl8723bs related patches which are being sent in order to not
cause merge conflicts. And on top of that I don't see a point in
staging driver getting "improved" if it's getting deleted in the same
cycle. I also forgot to mention that once the patch that removes
staging driver got merged into wireless-next linux-next had merge
conflict and its maintainer fixed the conflict by removing those files
and Greg said feel free to delete it. He also said in conversation
with Ping-Ke Shih and me that we can delete it, so I believe it would
be the best just let them get deleted without any further issues.

This email it is dictated by voice, not written by hand because I'm
currently outside so apologies in advance if something is repeated or
there's some issues with it.

Best regards,
Luka Gejak
