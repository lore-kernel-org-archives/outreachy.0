Hello Pavel and Dan,
I looked at the surround code and places where the proposed patch will have an
impact. As you rightly pointed out this array can't be treated as a flexible
array since it fits right in the middle of another struct.

I am wondering if ijk_matrix_regs_set (or IQKMatrixRegSetting) is a one element
array, why is it declared as a two dimensional array? Can this be a simple one
dimensional array instead? Is this the cleanup you are referring to when you say
"code is messy and should be cleaned up"?


Thank you,
