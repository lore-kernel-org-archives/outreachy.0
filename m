Sorry I made a typo: kzalloc() -> vzalloc().

Same here: kzalloc() -> vzalloc().

Did you find out where is the line that calls vzalloc() and returns the 
address to the local variable called "ptr"?

As, said before. You should delete it too, otherwise you lose that region 
of memory until the driver is un-linked by "modprobe -r <driver>" or the 
system is shutdown.
