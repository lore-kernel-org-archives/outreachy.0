Hello Greg,
Most of these macro defines appear to be unused in the module anywhere.
I can simply delete the #defines for these and let the original function
names be retained.
The other way is to rename the functions by the defined value. So, we will have
to make the code change to use the foo_rsl symbol names at all places. This will
be a bigger change involving the API name change itself.

I am unable to determine the initial intention as to why these #defines were
added. Can you please suggest what would be the recommended way for the clean up
of these unused macros?

Thank you,
