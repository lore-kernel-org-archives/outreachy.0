I actually fall just the other way.  They are little endian so we
should mark them as such, whether or not we are going to do any
conversions on them in kernel. It acts as a form of documentation
and makes it a little more obvious what the code is doing.
It gets vaguer with buffer as that is a mixed endian beast.
If you really want that one right you could use a structure, but
honestly it's not worth the hassle.

Absolutely (I missed that in the original reviews!)
