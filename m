Hello,
pardon my limited understanding, but I think this function call is not
necessary.

I may be wrong, but I do not think there is a change in the long, but I may
entirely wrong. The function was called from inside the lock scope, now we are
extracting the value directly, still inside the lock scope. This should be safe.

Sure. That is fine.

I am eagerly waiting for a feedback from the maintainer. If they agree with my
viewpoint, I will continue to work on this change outside of the clean up patch
tasks. I will be happy to :)

Thank you Greg!
